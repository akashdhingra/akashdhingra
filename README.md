# GitHub Stats Card

Copy-paste this into your markdown content, and that's it. Simple!

Change the `?username=` value to your GitHub's username.

```md
[![Akash's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=akashdhingra)](https://github.com/akashdhingra/github-readme-stats)
```

_Note: Available ranks are S+ (top 1%), S (top 25%), A++ (top 45%), A+ (top 60%), and B+ (everyone).
The values are calculated by using the [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) using commits, contributions, issues, stars, pull requests, followers, and owned repositories.
The implementation can be investigated at [src/calculateRank.js](./src/calculateRank.js)._
